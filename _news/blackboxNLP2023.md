Excited to announce that 2 of my works were accepted to BlackboxNLP this year. [Memory Injections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05605) was accepted as a full paper and [Attention Lens](https://github.com/msakarvadia/AttentionLens/tree/main) was accepted as an extended abstract. Looking forward to presenting my work!
