Hello! I am a first-year Department of Energy [Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Chicago](https://cs.uchicago.edu/). I am a member of [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/) where I am co-advised by [Ian Foster](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/ian-foster/) and [Kyle Chard](https://kylechard.com/). I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Environmental Science at the [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) and previously interned at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/).

Currently, I am very interested in the emerging field of [mechanistic interpretability](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/mech-interp-essay/index.html). Mechanistic Interpretability research aims to systematically reverse engineer neural networks to interpret their weights. Specifically, I love to investigate how neural networks are able to do things like:
* Factual recall
* Multi-hop and common sense reasoning
* Question answering
* Knowledge retrieval
* Catastrophic forgetting
* In-context learning
* Anomalous behavior
* (and much more!)

By understanding how neural networks implement these algorithms (above) in their weights, I hope to develop interventions to better align AI systems with human goals. Some examples of this are:
* Editing/correcting learned concepts/associations
* Localizing/mitigating bias
* Obscuring/unlearning sensitive information
* De-parameterizing over-parameterized models
* Patching ML vulnerabilities (e.g. backdoors)
* Developing more efficient/targeted learning strategies
* (and the list goes on!)

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
