  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={We aim to assess if enlarged extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (EA-CSF) volume at neonatal age is associated with a child’s performance on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) at 12 and 24 months of age. 3T MRI scans were acquired from 651 infants at neonate age (20.8+/-8.9 postnatal days). EA-CSF and global tissue volumes were computed via a new tool called AutoEACSF1. The MSEL was administered to these infants at 12 and 24 months, measuring ability in gross motor and four domains that comprise an overall cognitive composite score: fine motor, visual reception, receptive language, expressive language. General linear models including intracranial cavity volume, gestational age at birth, maternal education and sex as covariate were employed. The subgroup of infants whose EA-CSF volumes measured in the top 5th percentile (i.e., 2 SDs above the mean; n=33) displayed significant negative correlations between elevated EA-CSF at neonatal age and expressive language (p=0.001) and cognitive composite scores (p=0.016) at 12 months. However, at 24 months of age, these associations were no longer significant. No significant associations were found for subjects with EACSF volumes below the top 10th percentile. This study finds that atypically high levels of EA-CSF volume shortly after birth are associated with lower expressive language and overall cognitive ability at 12 months of age. These results suggest that there may be a pathological threshold of high EA-CSF volume that could serve as an early biomarker of a child’s reduced cognitive ability at 12 months.}
